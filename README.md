# Basic Character Recognition Tutorial
The basic character recognition tutorial demonstrates how to extract isolated characters/digits from the images using the __[scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)__ library which is an image processing in python and predict the image using the __[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)__, machine learning in python, to classify and predict the isolated character/digit images.

## Objectives  
- Coding a basic character recognition program using Python programming language.
- Extract isolated characters/digits from the images.
- Create pixel-based method as a feature vector and save into text file.
- Create first model and prediction using Nearest centroid classifier.
- Using another machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree, ensemble method, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) to create the model and prediction the isolated character/digit images. 
- Tuning parameters using grid search technique.
